          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny‚Äôs worth.

          ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working
          as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
          easy.

          ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find

          be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
          junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
          personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
        </h3>
        <p class="text-xs leading-5 opacity-65">
          ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
          program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
          were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
          agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
          learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
          have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an
          example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
          job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
          recommend! ‚Äù
